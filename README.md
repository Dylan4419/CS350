# CS350
Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

For this project, we worked with a SimpleLink CC3220s microcontroller to develop code in Code Composer Studio that would run on the microcontroller like a thermostat. We utilized UART to simulate the microcontroller communicating with servers, I2C was used to read the temperature, and GPIO was used to work with the LEDs and buttons on the controller. By the end of the course the controller was function as if it were a thermostat.

What did you do particularly well?

For this course it was important to stay on task and not fall behind. I made sure to keep myself organized and to start early each week in the event I would get stuck. I also believe I did a good job creating clean and reusable code. 

Where could you improve?

I donâ€™t know if I would call this an area I would like to improve, but I would like to learn even more about embedded systems. After this course and the coursework it was impressive to learn how much we count on embedded systems in our everyday lives. 

What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?

I look forward to working more in Code Composer Studio as it was interesting to work with in this course. There website has a lot of good information and I found myself on a couple occasions using their forums to help figure things out. 

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?

Anytime you get the opportunity to code something that you have never done before you are going to learn take something away from it to use on future projects. This could even be areas you feel you need to improve and for projects in the future may avoid making the same mistakes. 

How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I always try to use terms that are easy to understand while also doing my best to write good comments. I find that when I go back to a project I have not worked on in a while that my comments help me to remember what the code is doing at certain points.
